#Matura_Percolation

This repository contains the files described and used in chapter 3 of the Maturaarbeit of Giuseppe Lomoro on Percolation.

The first file, "Test Listen.py", was the first file and is the file talked about in chapter 3.2.1
After it, in chapter 3.2.2, came file "test neuneu.py", which was a midstep since directly after it, in chapter 3.2.3, it was divided into 2 files. "grid_2.py" and "iteration.py".
These two were at the end renamed "grid_2_safety_file.py" and respectively "Safety_save_iteration.py" (which are the ones found here) in chapter 3.3 since to note loose a functional code a copy was created. 
The 2 files now named "grid_2.py" and "iteration.py" are the files that have the quicksort algorithm built in.
